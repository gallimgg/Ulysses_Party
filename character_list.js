His son, Rudy, passed away 11 days after birth, and it has sent his marriage into a downturn for the last decade.

However, he is having his own emotional affair by mail with Martha Clifford. During his day about Dublin, he masturbates to Gertie McDowell on the beach. Being a superstitious man, he carries an old shriveled potato around with him, that Zoe Higgins takes from him during his visit to Bella Cohen's brothel. Also during this visit, he has hallucinations. This entails him having delusions of grandeur, a dominatrix visit from Bella Cohen, and a courtroom trial facing all of his guilts."
